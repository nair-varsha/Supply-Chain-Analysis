# Supply-Chain-Analysis
Project Title:
Data-Driven Optimization of Supply Chain Operations

Key Components:
Data Integration & Cleaning:
Consolidated and cleaned data from multiple supply chain segments, including sales, inventory, manufacturing, logistics, and quality control.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed trends and outliers in sales, lead times, defect rates, and shipping performance to identify inefficiencies.

Visualization:
Built dashboards and visual reports to communicate key supply chain metrics using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and Power BI/Tableau.

Demand Forecasting:
Used statistical and machine learning models to forecast product demand and guide production and inventory planning.

Operational Optimization:
Identified cost-saving opportunities in procurement, transportation modes, and inventory stocking strategies.

Quality and Risk Analysis:
Evaluated inspection results and defect rates to identify suppliers or products contributing to quality issues.

Impact:
Enhanced supply chain efficiency by improving demand forecasting, reducing logistics and inventory costs, and identifying quality and process inefficienciesâ€”enabling smarter, data-driven decision-making.
