**Project Title:**
Supply-Chain-Analysis

**Key Components:**
Data Integration & Cleaning:
Consolidated and cleaned data from multiple supply chain segments, including sales, inventory, manufacturing, logistics, and quality control.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed trends and outliers in sales, lead times, defect rates, and shipping performance to identify inefficiencies.

Visualization:
Built dashboards and visual reports to communicate key supply chain metrics using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and Power BI/Tableau.

**Impact:**
Enhanced supply chain efficiency by improving demand forecasting, reducing logistics and inventory costs, and identifying quality and process inefficienciesâ€”enabling smarter, data-driven decision-making.
